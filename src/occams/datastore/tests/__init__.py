"""
Collection of unit testing scripts.
Ideally, these tests should be in their resource module, as having them
sit next to production code can be risky. As such, these scripts are given
as-is and no support will be given if they are imported from another module.
See ``occams.datastore.testing`` for importing the DataStore testing layer.
